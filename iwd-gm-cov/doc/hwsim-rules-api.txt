RuleManager hierarchy
=====================

Service		net.connman.hwsim
Interface	net.connman.hwsim.RuleManager [Experimental]
Object path	/

Methods		object AddRule()
			Create a new blank rule entry. This rule will
			match all frames but apply no changes to the frames
			until the properties are written some non-default
			values.  Rules may affect frames being sent over
			the wireless medium.  Some properties of a rule
			determine what frames match it, other properties
			determine the effect on matching frames.  When
			a frame goes through the simulated medium all
			matching rules are applied according to their
			priority property.  See below for specifics on
			those properties.

Service		net.connman.hwsim
Interface	net.connman.hwsim.Rule [Experimental]
Object path	/{rule0,rule1,...}

Methods		void Remove()
			Remove this rule.

Properties	string Source
			Source device's hardware address in the
			XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX format or "any".  The Source
			and Destination addresses refer to the hardware
			addresses of the source and the destination
			radios as given by the
			net.connman.hwsim.Radio.Addresses property
			on the radio object (see hwsim-radio-api.txt).
			While those addresses initially match the network
			interface mac addresses, and that present in the
			ethernet headers of each frame, they are
			independent.

		string Destination
			Destination device's hardware address in the
			XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX format, or one of: "any",
			"multicast".

		boolean Bidirectional
			If false, rule matches frames from Source to
			Destination.  If true, also matches frames from
			Destination to Source.

		uint32 Frequency
			If non-zero, rule matches specified center
			frequency only.

		int16 Priority
			Rule priority / preference / metric.  The rule
			will be processed after any rule with a lower
			Priority value and may override properties
			already modified.

		int16 SignalStrength
			Signal strength (RSSI) value to set on matching
			frames to be seen by the receiver, or zero.  If
			zero, no change is applied.  Signal strength is
			expressed in 100 * dBm.  The value is in the range
			of -1 (strongest signal) to -10000 (weakest
			signal).

		bool Drop
			If true, nothing is passed to the receiver.
