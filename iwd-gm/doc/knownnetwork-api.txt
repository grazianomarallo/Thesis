======================

Service		net.connman.iwd
Interface	net.connman.iwd.KnownNetwork [Experimental]
Object path	/Xxx

Methods		void Forget()

			Removes the network from the 'known networks' list and
			removes any associated configuration data.  If the
			network is currently connected, then it is immediately
			disconnected.

Properties	string Name [readonly]

			Contains the Name (SSID) of the network

		string Type [readonly]

			Contains the type of the network.  Possible
			types are "open", "psk", "8021x" (EAP)

		bool Hidden [readonly]

			True if this is a hidden network.  The existence of
			an object with this property set to True -- either
			preprovisioned or created after a successful
			net.connman.iwd.Device.ConnectHiddenNetwork() --
			enables IWD to scan for and show this network in
			the scan results.

		string LastConnectedTime [readonly, optional]

			Contains the last time this network has been
			successfully connected to.  The time is given as a
			ISO 8601-formatted string.  If the network is known
			but has never been successfully connected to,
			this property is not visible.
