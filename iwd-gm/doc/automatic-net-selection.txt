When IWD is searching for a network to connect to automatically, the following
factors are taken into account:

- Signal strength level

- Is the network a legacy WPA network, or RSN compliant?  More weight is given
  to networks that are RSN compliant.

- Is the network Open or requires authentication?  More weight is given to
  networks that require authentication.

- Does the network support privacy in its Capability Information field?  More
  weight is given to BSSes that do.

- Maximum rate of the network

- Channel Utilization (from BSS Load) of the network

- Has the network been connected to before and if so, how long ago?  Networks
  that have not been connected to previously are ignored for auto-connect
  purposes.
