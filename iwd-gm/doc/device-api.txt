Object path	/{phy0,phy1,...}/{1,2,...}

Properties	string Name [readonly]

			Device's interface name

		string Address [readonly]

			Interface's hardware address in the XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
			format

		boolean Powered [readwrite]

			True if the interface is UP.  If false, the device's
			radio is powered down and no other actions can
			be performed on the device.

		boolean WDS [readwrite]

			True if the interface is set to use the 4-address
			format for the 802.11 packet header. If false, the
			classic format is used. When activated, the interface
			can be added to a Layer2 bridge to create a WDS.

		object Adapter [readonly]

			The object path of the adapter the device belongs to.

		string Mode [readwrite]

			Use to set the device mode. The following device modes
			are valid:
				'ad-hoc'
				'station'
				'ap'

			When the device mode is changed, the interfaces
			available for that device might also change.  For
			example, setting the mode to 'ap' will cause the
			AccessPoint interface to appear.  If the device mode
			is switched back to another mode, then 'AccessPoint'
			interface will no longer be available.
